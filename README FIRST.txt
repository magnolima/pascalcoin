# Pascal Coin: P2P Cryptocurrency without need of historical operations.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE.

* Delphi simple convert by Magno Lima

This is the compiled Delphi version, tested on Delphi Tokyo 10.2.1

Maybe you should change this first:

At Project->Options->Directories and Conditionals, you should change for the folder you extracted, default for my config is the following:

D:\DEVELOPER\PascalCoin\VCL\PIP;D:\DEVELOPER\PascalCoin\VCL\PasOpenCL;D:\DEVELOPER\PascalCoin\VCL\Synapse;D:\DEVELOPER\PascalCoin\VCL\Units;

Modify and change that option, everything should be compiled fine.

The unique changes were small refactory but my intention was solo compile it in Delphi and I think it is compatible with both now, FPC and Delphi.
